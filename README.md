### Hi there, I'm Tagir 👋

and I am a chemoinformatician and AI researcher with a strong passion for reaction informatics and generative modelling!

- 🔬 As Postdoctoral Researcher between Eli Lilly and [Laboratory of Chemoinformatics](https://infochim.u-strasbg.fr), I am working on the intersection of chemical space visualisation, AI research and software development.
- 🎓 I completed my PhD at the [Laboratory of Chemoinformatics](https://infochim.u-strasbg.fr), where my research focused on the [Graph-based neural networks for generation of synthetically accessible molecular structures](https://theses.fr/2023STRAF010). My work integrated generative graph neural networks with reinforcement learning-based retrosynthesis tools, aiming to design novel compounds and develop synthetic pathways to them.
- 🎮 But most of all, I am a passionate developer and scientist who loves new challenges in the field of computational chemistry!
